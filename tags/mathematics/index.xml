      <description>Some time ago Numberphile released a series of videos concerning sequences in the OEIS with pretty plots. Inspired, I wrote a little Twitter bot that tweets out two such plots each day. I even got a follow from 3Blue1Brown. It was a wonderful source of dopamine for a while.
Because I hacked the thing together in a dayYou can check out the source code, if you&amp;rsquo;re okay with your eyes melting out of your skull.</description>

      <description>While doing some research for my Project Euler post, I found myself drawn to something else that blew my mind in high school &amp;mdash; the connection between the greatest common divisor and the Riemann zeta function.
For those of you just joining us:
The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers is the largest positive number that divides them both. The Riemann zeta function is the series \[\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac1{n^s} = \frac1{1^s} + \frac1{2^s} + \frac1{3^s} + \cdots.</description>

      <title>Project Euler 1-100 in 49 hours</title>

      <description>Project Euler is how I taught myself Python in high school, and so I find it incredibly nostalgic. It took 13-year-old me a lot of Googling and a few months to get through the first 100 problems. Why 100 specifically? Because I wanted to write this post honestly and those are the ones I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to talk about without them locking my account or something.
10-odd years and a graduate degree later, I decided to come back and solve them as fast as I could.</description>
