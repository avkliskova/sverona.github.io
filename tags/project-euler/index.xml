It took 13-year-old me a lot of Googling and a few months to get through the first 100 problems.
10-odd years and a graduate degree later, I decided to come back and solve them as fast as I could. I&amp;rsquo;m no competitive programmer, but 24 hours seemed reasonable. Fortunately, I lack the stamina to code for that long, so I did it over a few days instead.</description></item></channel></rss>
