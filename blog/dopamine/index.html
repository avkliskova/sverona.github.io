  <p><em>Brutalism</em> is from the French <em>brut,</em> meaning <em>raw,</em> evoking <a href="">raw concrete.</a></p>
<p>It is also very often <em>brutal</em> in that it throws cold water on your new ideas that make you excited to try and write and test. <em>No!</em> Only raw concrete.</p>
<p>I really enjoy seeing cool stuff done with the Web. My design philosophies, however, run increasingly <em>brutal</em> &mdash; that is to say, aggressively minimalist. This is often frustrating. Brutalism&rsquo;s answer to seemingly <em>everything</em> that is cool or pretty is slapping your hands away and saying &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t gonna need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet somehow raw concrete can still be <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Habitat_67%2C_southwest_view.jpg/1920px-Habitat_67%2C_southwest_view.jpg">very beautiful.</a></p>
<p>I would like to think that my little page is brutalist <em>and</em> beautiful. Here is a dictum that I&rsquo;ve tried to hew to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;start with left-aligned black text on a white background, and [&hellip;] apply styling only to solve a specific problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<footer><cite><a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">Adam Morse, quoted by David Copeland</a></cite></footer>
<p>I have allowed myself basically three vanities: a nice serif font, minimal sidenotes, and \(\LaTeX.\) Otherwise my page runs on about a hundred lines of Sass.</p>
<p>This has been refreshing. So much of the tech world is an exercise in building whole Jenga towers worth of indirection to harvest people&rsquo;s data and screw with their brains. It&rsquo;s nice to use the magic web of wires and conflict minerals to just <em>write something</em> for a change.</p>
<p>Is it worth anything?</p>
<p>Will anyone ever read it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
