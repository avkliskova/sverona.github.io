We now present the centerpiece of the work. Throughout, write
\\([n] = \mathbb N \cap [1, n].\\)

## The DCS relations 

::: definition
 Let \\(L\\) be a diamond-colored distributive lattice
with edges colored by \\([n]\\), and let \\(x \in L\\). For each
\\(i \in \mathbb N\\), let \\(\top\_i(x) \in L\\) be the maximum element of the
\\(i\\)-component in which \\(x\\) lies.

Define a weight function[^1] \\(\omega(x) = [\omega\_i(x)]\_{i=1}^n\\) by
\\[\omega\_i(x) = \rho\_i(x) - (\rho\_i(\top\_i(x)) - \rho\_i(x)) = 2\rho\_i(x) - \rho\_i(\top\_i(x)).\\]

:::

::: definition
 Let \\(\Phi\\) be a rank-\\(n\\) root system with base
\\(\Delta\\), and let \\(\mathfrak g\\) be the corresponding semisimple Lie
algebra with Chevalley generators \\(\{x\_i, y\_i, h\_i\}\_{i=1}^n.\\) Let \\(M\\)
be the Cartan matrix of \\(\mathfrak g\\). Let \\(L\\) be a diamond-colored
distributive lattice with edge colors corresponding to \\(\Delta.\\)

Then \\(L\\) is said to be \\(\mathfrak g\\)-*structured* if for any edge
\\(x \overset{i}\to y\\) in \\(L\\), \\(\omega(y) - \omega(x)\\) gives the \\(i\\)th row
of \\(M\\). 
:::

::: theorem
[Donnelly]
Let \\(L\\) be a \\(\mathfrak g\\)-structured DCDL. If for any edge \\(x \to y\\) there exist \\(c\_{yx}, d\_{xy} \in \mathbb{C}\\) such that
1. if \\(w, x, y, z \in L\\) form a diamond with \\(w \to x \to z\\), \\(w \to y \to z\\), we have the *diamond relations* \\(c\_{yw}d\_{wx} = d\_{xz}c\_{zy}, c\_{xw}d\_{wy} = d\_{yz}c\_{zx},\\)
2. and for any \\(x \in L\\) and any \\(i \in [n]\\), we have the *crossing relation*
\\[\sum\_{\substack{w \in L \\\ w \xrightarrow{i} x}} c\_{xw}d\_{wx} - \sum\_{\substack{z \in L \\\ x \xrightarrow{i} z}} c\_{zx}d\_{xz} = \omega\_i(x),\\]

then \\(\mathfrak g\\) is homomorphic to the Lie algebra \\(\mathfrak l\\) generated by the \\(3n\\) \\(|L|\\)-dimensional matrices \\(\{E\_i, F\_i, H\_i\}\_{i=1}^n\\) (whose rows and columns are indexed by the elements of \\(L\\)) defined as follows:
1. \\([E\_i]\_{yx} \coloneqq c\_{yx}\\) if \\(x \xrightarrow{i} y\\), or \\(0\\) otherwise;
2. \\([F\_i]\_{xy} \coloneqq d\_{xy}\\) if \\(x \xrightarrow{i} y\\), or \\(0\\) otherwise;
3. \\(H\_i \coloneqq [E\_iF\_i].\\)

We say that
1. the coefficients \\(\{c\_{yx}, d\_{xy}\}\_{x,y \in L}\\) are *DCS-satisfactory* for \\(\mathfrak g\\), and that
2. \\(L\\) *realizes a representation of* \\(\mathfrak g\\).
Additionally, if \\(\mathfrak g\\) is simple, the representation so realized is faithful.

:::

::: proof
 See Appendix B. 
:::

::: definition
 If a DCDL \\(L\\) realizes a representation of
\\(\mathfrak g\\), and the associated DCS-satisfactory coefficients
\\(\{c\_{yx}, d\_{xy}\}\\) are uniquely determined, we say that the lattice
\\(L\\) is *solitary*.

If instead the *edge products* \\(\pi\_{xy} \coloneqq c\_{yx}d\_{xy}\\) are
uniquely determined, then \\(L\\) is said to be *product solitary.*

If we work with edge products rather than edge coefficients, the DCS
relations become the following. (The structure relations, which deal
with vertex weights, remain unchanged.)

1.  If \\(w, x, y, z \in L\\) form a diamond with \\(w \to x \to z\\),
    \\(w \to y \to z\\), we have the *diamond relation*
    \\(\pi\_{xz}\pi\_{yz} = \pi\_{wx}\pi     \_{wy}.\\)
2.  For any \\(x \in L\\) and any \\(i \in [n]\\), we have the *crossing
    relation*

\\[\sum\_{\substack{w \in L \\\ w \xrightarrow{i} x}} \pi\_{wx} - \sum\_{\substack{z \in L \\\ x \xrightarrow{i} z}} \pi\_{xz} = \omega\_i(x).\\]

:::

::: proposition
 Suppose a lattice \\(L\\) is chain-factorizable, and
suppose there exist a set of positive rational DCS-satisfactory edge
products. If the edge products on one face of \\(L\\) are uniquely
determined, then \\(L\\) is product solitary. 
:::
::: proof

Let \\(L\_{k,j}\\) be a face of \\(L\\), and suppose the edge coefficients on
\\(L\_{k,j}\\) are uniquely determined.

1.  Let \\(x \in L\_{k,j}.\\) Since \\(j\\) is extremal, there is exactly one
    edge incident to \\(x\\) that does not belong to the face \\(L\_{k,j}.\\)
    Call it \\(x \to x'.\\) Its edge product is uniquely determined by a
    crossing relation at \\(x.\\)
2.  Suppose without loss of generality that \\(j\\) is minimal. Consider an
    edge \\(x' \to y'\\) in \\(L\_{k,j+1}.\\) Since \\(L\\) is chain-factorizable,
    \\(x' \to y'\\) is part of a diamond \\(x \to x' \to y'\\),
    \\(x \to y \to y'\\). The edges \\(x \to x'\\), \\(y \to y'\\) are determined
    uniquely by (1), and the edge \\(x \to y\\) is determined uniquely by
    assumption. Thus the edge \\(x' \to y'\\) is determined uniquely by the
    diamond relation.

If \\(j + 1\\) is nonmaximal, this argument can be repeated to show that the
edge products in \\(L\_{k,j+2}\\) and the edge products of the edges
connecting \\(L\_{k,j+1}\\) and \\(L\_{k, j + 2}\\) are uniquely determined, and
similarly for successive slices. Since \\(L\\) is chain-factorizable, this
process determines every edge product in \\(L\\). 
:::

## Example: chains

::: definition
 The *\\(n\\)-edge chain* is the lattice with vertex
set \\(\{v\_0, v\_1, \dots, v\_n\}\\) and a total ordering. Every edge is
assigned the same color, so that the Hasse diagram of the lattice is
\\[v\_0 \overset{1}\to v\_1 \overset{1}\to \dots \overset{1}\to v\_n.\\]
:::

::: proposition
 The \\(n\\)-edge chain realizes a
representation of the Lie algebra \\(A\_1\\), whose Cartan matrix is
\\(\operatorname{diag}(2).\\) 
:::
::: proof
 That the
\\(n\\)-edge chain is \\(A\_1\\)-structured is immediate from
\\(\omega\_1(v\_i) = 2i - n.\\) The reader may verify that choosing
\\(c\_{v\_i,v\_{i-1}} = n - i + 1\\) and \\(d\_{v\_{i-1}, v\_i} = i\\) gives a
DCS-satisfactory set of coefficients. 
:::

::: example

Let\'s verify the DCS theorem for a 2-edge chain:
\\(v\_0 \overset{1}\to v\_1 \overset{1}\to v\_2.\\) We have the following
information. \\[\begin{array}{rr|crr}
\mathbf i & \mathbf{\omega\_1(v\_i)} & \mathbf{x \overset{i}\to y} & \mathbf{c\_{yx}} & \mathbf{d\_{xy}}\\\\
\hline
0 & -2 & v\_0 \overset{1}\to v\_1 & 2 & 1 \\\\
1 & 0 &  v\_1 \overset{1}\to v\_2 & 1 & 2 \\\\
2 & 2 \\\\
\end{array}\\]

We can then fill out the matrices \\[\begin{aligned}
E=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}, 
F=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}, 
H = [EF] =
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2
\end{bmatrix}. 
\end{aligned}\\]

To show that a representation of \\(A\_1\\) is actually realized, we verify
the Serre relations \\([HE] = 2E\\), \\([HF] = -2F.\\) This step is left to the
reader.

## Example: Boolean lattices 

::: definition
 The *Boolean lattice* \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) is defined as
follows.

1.  Vertices of \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) are subsets \\(x \subseteq [n].\\)
2.  \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) is ordered by containment; if
    \\(x, y \in \mathscr B\_n,\\) \\(x \leq y\\) if \\(x \subseteq y.\\)
3.  If \\(x, y \in \mathscr B\_n,\\) \\(\rho(x) = |x|\\), and consequently
    \\(x \to y\\) if and only if \\(|y \setminus x| = 1.\\)
4.  Edges in \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) are colored by \\([n]\\); the edge \\(x \to y\\) has
    color given by the element of the singleton set \\(y \setminus x.\\)
5.  \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) embeds into \\(\mathbb Z^n\\) as follows: if
    \\(x \in \mathscr B\_n\\), let \\(\phi(x)\\) be the \\(n\\)-vector whose \\(i\\)th
    element is \\(1\\) if \\(i \in x\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise.


:::

::: proposition
 The join-irreducible elements of \\(\mathscr B\_n\\)
are the singleton sets \\(\{i\}\\) for each \\(i \in [n].\\) 
:::

::: proof
 Left to reader. 
:::

::: corollary

\\(j(\mathscr B\_n)\\) is a poset of \\(n\\) mutually incomparable elements.^[Called an *antichain* of length \\(n\\).]
The Hasse diagram of the lattice \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) is an \\(n\\)-hypercube.

:::

::: proposition
 The Boolean lattice \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) realizes a
representation of the Lie algebra \\(A\_1^n = \bigoplus\_{i=1}^n A\_1\\), whose
Cartan matrix is \\(\operatorname{diag}(2, 2, \dots, 2).\\) 
:::

::: proof
 First we show that \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) is
\\(A\_n^1\\)-structured. Take \\(i, j \in [n]\\) with \\(i \not = j\\); it suffices
to show that \\(M\_{ij} = 0.\\)

Observe that every \\(i\\)-component of \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) is a one-edge chain.
Thus consider an edge \\(x \overset{i}\to y.\\) Evidently \\(\omega\_i(x) = -1\\)
and \\(\omega\_i(y) = 1.\\) We need to show that
\\(M\_{ij} = \omega\_j(y) - \omega\_j(x) = 0.\\) This is apparent since
\\(j \in x\\) if and only if \\(j \in y.\\)

Since every \\(i\\)-component of \\(\mathscr B\_n\\) is a one-edge chain, taking
\\(c\_{yx} = d\_{xy} = 1\\) for every \\(x \to y\\) gives a DCS-satisfactory set
of coefficients.

## Example: zero-padded subset lattices

::: definition
 The *zero-padded subset lattice* \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\)
(hereinafter *ZPS lattice*) is defined as follows.

1.  Vertices of \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) are subsets \\(x \subseteq [n].\\)
2.  If \\(x, y \in \mathscr Z\_n\\), enumerate the elements of (for instance)
    \\(x\\) by \\(x\_1 \geq \dots \geq x\_n\\), letting \\(x\_j = 0\\) if
    \\(j > \vert x \vert\\). Then \\(x \leq y\\) if \\(x\_i \leq y\_i\\) for all
    \\(i \in [n]\\).
3.  If \\(x, y \in \mathscr Z\_n\\), \\(\rho(x) = \sum\_{i=1}^n x\_i\\); we have
    \\(x \to y\\) if and only if \\(x\\), \\(y\\) differ in exactly one index
    \\(i \in [n]\\), with \\(x\_i + 1 = y\_i.\\)
4.  Edges in \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) are colored by \\([n].\\) Keeping the above
    setup, the edge \\(x \to y\\) has color \\(n - x\_i.\\)
5.  \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) embeds directly into \\(\mathbb Z^n\\) using the
    enumeration in (2) above. 
:::

The ZPS lattices were used in [@proctor] (in which \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) is
called \\(M(n)\\)) to prove a conjecture of Erdős concerning subset sums.

::: proposition
 The join-irreducible elements of \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\)
are those whose nonzero elements are consecutive. 
:::
::: proof
 Follows from Corollary 2.1; left to reader.

:::

Thus \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) is the lattice of order ideals of the
\"angelfish\'\' poset given by ordering the set
\\(\{(i, j) : 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n\}\\) componentwise.

::: proposition
 The ZPS lattice \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) realizes a
representation of the Lie algebra \\(B\_n\\), whose Cartan matrix is
\\[M \coloneqq \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 & & & & \\\\
-1 & 2 & -1 & & &\\\\
& -1 & 2 & \ddots & & \\\\
& & \ddots & \ddots & -1 & & \\\\
& & & -1 & 2 & -2 \\\\
& & & & -1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}.\\]
:::

::: proof
 We first show that
\\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) is \\(B\_n\\)-structured.

1.  As before, it is clear that if \\(x \overset{i}\to y\\), then
    \\(\omega\_i(y) - \omega\_i(x) = 2 = M\_{ii}.\\)
2.  If \\(x \overset{n-1}\to y\\), then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) differ in exactly one
    coordinate, which increments from \\(1\\) (in \\(x\\)) to \\(2\\) (in \\(y\\).)
    Consider the preceding coordinate as well; write
    \\(\square 1 \overset{n-1}\to \square 2.\\) (If there is no preceding
    coordinate, then \\(x\\) is maximal and there is no edge
    \\(x \overset{n - 1}\to y.\\))

    It is apparent that the square must be a \\(0\\). Thus, there must be a
    pattern of edges
    \\(00 \overset{n}\to 01 \overset{n-1}\to 02 \overset{n}\to 12.\\) Since
    every component of \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) is a length-one chain, this implies
    that \\(\omega\_n(x) = 1\\), \\(\omega\_n(y) = -1\\), so
    \\(\omega\_n(y) - \omega\_n(x) = -2 = M\_{n-1, n}.\\)

3. If \\(x \overset{n - 2} \to y\\), then we have
    \\(\square2 \overset{n-2}\to \square3\\). (Note that there must be a
    preceding coordinate in this case.) The square is either 0 or 1.

    1.  If the square is a 0, there is a pattern of edges
        \\(01 \overset{n - 1}\to 02 \overset{n-2}\to 03.\\) Observe that there
        can be no color-\\((n-1)\\) edge incident to \\(03.\\) So in this case
        \\(\omega\_{n-1}(y) - \omega\_{n-1}(x) = 0 - 1 = M\_{n-2,n-1}.\\)
    2.  If the square is a 1, there is a pattern of edges
        \\(12 \overset{n-2} \to 13 \overset{n-3}\to 23\\). Observe that there
        can be no color-\\((n-1)\\) edge incident to \\(12.\\) So in this case
        \\(\omega\_{n-1}(y) - \omega\_{n-1}(x) = -1 - 0 = M\_{n-2,n-1}.\\)

This argument goes through for any entry \\(M\_{n-k-1,n-k}\\),
\\(k = 1, \dots, n - 2.\\) A dual argument, considering succeeding
coordinates, goes through for \\(M\_{n-k+1,n-k},\\) \\(k = 1, \dots, n - 1.\\) We
leave this to the reader.

Since every \\(k\\)-component of \\(\mathscr Z\_n\\) is a length-one chain,
taking \\(c\_{yx} = d\_{xy} = 1\\) for every edge \\(x \to y\\) satisfies the DCS
relations. 
:::

## Example: Fibonaccian lattices

::: definition
 The *Fibonaccian lattice*
\\(L\_A^{Fib}(n, k) = \mathscr F(n, k)\\) is defined as follows.

1.  Vertices of \\(\mathscr F(n, k)\\) are \\(k\\)-tuples \\(x \in \mathbb Z^k\\)
    such that
    1.  \\(x\_i \in \{n(i - 1) + 1, \dots, ni\}\\) for each \\(i \in [k]\\);
    2.  if \\(x\_i = ni\\), then \\(x\_{i + 1} \not = ni + 1.\\)[^2]
2.  \\(\mathscr F(n, k)\\) is ordered componentwise: \\(x \leq y\\) if
    \\(x\_i \leq y\_i\\) for each \\(i \in [k].\\)
3.  If \\(x, y \in \mathscr F(n, k)\\), \\(x \to y\\) if and only if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)
    differ in exactly one component \\(i \in [k],\\) with \\(x\_i + 1 = y\_i.\\)
4.  Edges in \\(\mathscr F(n, k)\\) are colored by \\([n - 1]\\) depending on
    the value of \\(x\_i\\), using the *snake rule* diagrammed in Figure 3.2.
5.  \\(\mathscr F(n, k)\\) embeds directly into \\(\mathbb Z^k.\\)


:::

::: figure
 `\centering`{=latex} ![image](diagrams/snakerule.pdf)
\\\caption{The snake rule for \\(\mathscr F(n, k).\\)} 
:::

We now reproduce some results in [@donnelly-fibonaccian].

::: proposition
 The vertex cardinality of \\(\mathscr F(n, k)\\) is
\\((r\_1^{n+1} - r\_2^{n + 1})/(r\_1 - r\_2)\\), where \\(r\_{1,2}\\) are
respectively the positive and negative roots of \\(x^2 - nx - 1\\).
:::

::: proof
 The elements of \\(\mathscr F(n, k + 1)\\)
come about by appending an extra \"space\'\' at the end of an element of
\\(\mathscr F(n, k)\\). Clearly there are \\(n\\) possible choices for this
space. However, appending \\(nk + 1\\) to those elements of \\(F(n, k)\\) whose
last element is \\(nk\\), of which there are \\(|\mathscr F(n,k-1)|\\), violates
the consecutive-integer rule. Clearly every other choice is valid. Thus
\\[|\mathscr F(n, k + 1)| = n|\mathscr F(n, k)| - |\mathscr F(n, k - 1)|.\\]

The explicit formula then follows from a standard inductive
argument,[^3] which we leave to the reader. 
:::

::: corollary
 \\(|\mathscr F(n, 3)|\\) is the Fibonacci number
\\(F\_{2n + 2}.\\)

\iff 0 &= 9\alpha^2 - 12\alpha + 4 = (3\alpha- 2 )^2.
\end{aligned}\\] Thus \\(\alpha = 2/3.\\) The remaining coefficients are now
uniquely determined as positive rational numbers, as the reader may
verify.

::: theorem

\\(\mathscr F(4,3)\\) and \\(\mathscr F(5,3)\\) are product solitary.

:::
::: proof
[Proof by computer]
Figures 3.4 and 3.5 were generated by the author by using the software library SAGE to generate a Groebner basis for the nonlinear system of equations given by the diamond and crossing relations for each lattice. No other solutions exist.

[^1]: The quantity \\((\rho\_i(\top\_i(x)) - \rho\_i(x))\\) is the distance of
    \\(x\\) \"from the top\'\' of its \\(i\\)-component, whereas \\(\rho\_i(x)\\) is
    the distance of \\(x\\) \"from the bottom.\'\' Thus we sometimes call
    the former quantity the *depth* of \\(x\\), whereupon the color-\\(i\\)
    weight of \\(x\\) is \"rank minus depth.\'\'

[^2]: That is, \\(x\\) contains no consecutive integers.

[^3]: It can also be derived using generating functions.
