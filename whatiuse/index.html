It needs occasional maintenance, but this tends to be very inexpensive. At some point I would like to upgrade to a <a href=https://www.xyte.ch/t700-crowdfunding/>refurbished 4:3 model</a> &mdash; I keep a T60 in my desk for just such an occasion.</p><p><strong>Phone</strong>: My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S8, which I&rsquo;ve had since I was a teen because Phones Are Expensive. This represents a good chunk of my nonfree software usage, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting a PinePhone in the near future.</p><p><strong>Keyboard</strong>: I use an <a href=https://www.annepro.net/products/anne-pro-2>Anne Pro 2</a> with Kailh Box White switches, flashed with <a href=https://openannepro.github.io/>custom open-source firmware</a>.</p><h2 id=software>Software</h2><p>As far as I can, I strive to use open-source software. I am not a license geek; I tend to defer to my friends on such matters.</p><h3 id=desktop>Desktop</h3><p><strong>Distribution</strong>: I use <a href=https://archlinux.org>Arch</a> btw. In the past, I can recall using <a href=https://ubuntu.com>Ubuntu</a>, <a href=https://linuxmint.com>Mint</a>, <a href=https://getfedora.org>Fedora</a>, <a href=https://voidlinux.org>Void</a>, and <a href=https://nixos.org>NixOS</a>. I <em>really really enjoyed</em> NixOS, but it created too many yak-shaving problems when I wanted to install anything that wasn&rsquo;t prepackaged.</p><p><strong>AUR helper</strong>: I use <a href=https://github.com/Morganamilo>paru</a>. In the past I&rsquo;ve used <a href=https://github.com/Jguer/yay>yay</a> and yaourt, which is unmaintained.</p><p><strong>Window manager</strong>: I use <a href=https://xmonad.org>xmonad</a> with <a href=https://github.com/jaor/xmobar>xmobar</a>. In the past I&rsquo;ve used too many WMs to list. xmonad is the best.</p><p><strong>Terminal</strong>: I use <a href=https://alacritty.org>Alacritty</a>. In the past, I&rsquo;ve used <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rxvt-unicode>urxvt</a>, <a href=https://st.suckless.org>st</a>, <a href=https://github.com/dabisu/sakura>sakura</a>, and <a href=https://github.com/thestinger/termite>termite</a>.</p><p><strong>System font</strong>: I use <a href=https://indestructibletype.com/Drafting/>Drafting* Mono</a>, which fills my deeply held want for a pretty, open-source monospace serif font that I&rsquo;ve had ever since I saw <a href=https://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html>Triplicate</a>. In the past I&rsquo;ve used too many fonts to list here.</p><p><strong>Editor</strong>: I use <a href=https://neovim.io>neovim</a> and <a href=https://doomemacs.org>Doom</a> with about equal frequency, depending on what I&rsquo;m doing.</p><p><strong>Browser</strong>: I use <a href=https://qutebrowser.org>qutebrowser</a>, which is far and away my favorite.</p><p><strong>Search engine:</strong> I usually use <a href=https://searxng.org>SearXNG</a>.</p><p><strong>Music player:</strong> I tend to use <a href=https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp>ncmpcpp</a>.</p><h3 id=this-very-site>This very site</h3><p>This website runs on Hugo using a custom <a href=https://github.com/sverona/hugo-semiotic>theme</a> of my own design. It uses the <a href=https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-serif/>Source Serif</a> font. It uses <a href=https://katex.org>KaTeX</a> for math markup.</p><p>It is a proud member of the <a href=https://1mb.club>1mb.club</a>. The heaviest page on the site is somewhere around 800KB, almost all of which is font files.</p><h3 id=nonfree-software-that-i-still-use>Nonfree software that I still use</h3><p>I exclude from this list anything that I absolutely need to function &mdash; banking services, things like that. I am not RMS, who lives in a major city and apparently doesn&rsquo;t need to have normal human relationships, and I&rsquo;m not interested in taking things to his level.</p><p><strong>Firmware.</strong> There&rsquo;s probably a few blobs in my computer firmware, but right now this doesn&rsquo;t concern me too much.</p><p><strong>Discord.</strong> This is the really big one. I&rsquo;ve cleansed myself of most social networking software &mdash; Discord is the only straggler.<label for=sidenote-0 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox id=sidenote-0 class=margin-toggle><span class=sidenote>I have an obligatory presence on Twitter and LinkedIn but don&rsquo;t use either with any regularity.</span> I look forward to a utopian future in which everything is federated and nobody is locked into a proprietary client, but until then, I will conduct most of my business on Discord.<label for=sidenote-1 class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox id=sidenote-1 class=margin-toggle><span class=sidenote>However, I do consider myself a &ldquo;Discord accelerationist,&rdquo; in that I hope they go under and/or do a bunch of highly objectionable stuff so that I can successfully move most of my friends onto a better solution.</span></p><p><strong>Obsidian.</strong> This has the best mobile client I&rsquo;ve been able to find for notekeeping, so it&rsquo;s what I went with when my fiancé, a relative tech normie, asked me to establish a shared digital notebook. I use neither their paid services (I use <a href=https://syncthing.net>Syncthing</a> to share the folder) nor the desktop frontend (I use emacs with <a href=https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el>obsidian.el</a>.)</p><p><strong>Zoom.</strong> It is conceivable that in future I may have enough social leverage to demand that videoconferencing be done on Jitsi or similar, but presently I&rsquo;m a little too meek to make my friends install yet another app just to speak to me.</p><p><strong>YouTube.</strong> This is one of the last Google holdouts that is not inextricable from my phone. I have to admit that the direction of the platform irritates me more with each passing day, and I would like to separate myself from it entirely.</p><p><strong>Google Maps.</strong> I really like <a href=https://organicmaps.app>Organic Maps</a> as a replacement. The one killer feature Maps has that no OSM-based app does is reliable business listings, but that&rsquo;s not a huge deal anyway &mdash; Google listings are wrong more often than anything on a website.</p></article></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/sverona/hugo-semiotic>Hugo Semiotic</a></footer></body></html>
