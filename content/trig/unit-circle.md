It's time to connect the circle with the angles on it with what we learned in the previous section.

Consider a circle of radius 1. Using two radii, form an angle in standard position (see diagram in class.) What happens as the angle increases from zero to \\(360^\circ\\) or \\(2\pi\\) radians?

(Consider the coordinates at special angles; show that they form special right triangles with hypotenuse 1.)

Connect this to sine and cosine.
