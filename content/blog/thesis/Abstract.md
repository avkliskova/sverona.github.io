There exists a natural correspondence between the bases for a given finite-dimen\-sional representation of a complex semisimple Lie algebra and a certain collection of finite edge-colored ranked posets, laid out by Donnelly, et al.Â in, for instance, \cite{donnelly-extremal}. In this correspondence, the Serre relations on the Chevalley generators of the given Lie algebra are realized as conditions on coefficients assigned to poset edges. These conditions are the so-called *diamond, crossing, and structure relations* (hereinafter *DCS relations*.) New representation constructions of Lie algebras may thus be obtained by utilizing edge-colored ranked posets. Of particular combinatorial interest are those representations whose corresponding posets are distributive lattices.

We study two families of such lattices, which we dub the *generalized Fibonaccian lattices* \(L\_A^{Fib}(n + 1, k)\) and *generalized Catalanian lattices* \(L\_C^{Cat}(n, k)\). These respectively generalize known families of lattices which are DCS-corre\-spondent to some special families of representations of the classical Lie algebras \(A\_{n + 1}\) and \(C\_n\). We state and prove explicit formulae for the vertex cardinalities of these lattices; show existence and uniqueness of DCS-satisfactory edge coefficients for certain values of \(n\) and \(k\); and report on the efficacy of various computational and algorithmic approaches to this problem. A Python library for computationally modeling and ``solving" these lattices appears as an appendix.
