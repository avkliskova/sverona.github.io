For those of you just joining us:
The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers is the largest positive number that divides them both. The Riemann zeta function is the series \[\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac1{n^s} = \frac1{1^s} + \frac1{2^s} + \frac1{3^s} + \cdots.</description></item><item><title>Project Euler 1-100 in 49 hours</title><link>https://sverona.github.io/blog/project-euler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.github.io/blog/project-euler/</guid><description>Project Euler is how I taught myself Python in high school, and so I find it incredibly nostalgic. It took 13-year-old me a lot of Googling and a few months to get through the first 100 problems.
10-odd years and a graduate degree later, I decided to come back and solve them as fast as I could. I&amp;rsquo;m no competitive programmer, but 24 hours seemed reasonable. Fortunately, I lack the stamina to code for that long, so I did it over a few days instead.</description></item></channel></rss>
