You have 15 minutes. Please show all your work; if I can't follow your logic, I can't give you partial credit.

\textbf{Please put anything with a screen (except calculators) out of sight and leave them that way until you have left the classroom.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine whether a triangle with side lengths 7, 24, 25 is right.
  \item Add the angles \(40^\circ 30' 20"\) and \(50^\circ 40' 12"\) and express your answer in degrees, minutes, and seconds.
  \item Convert the angle \(135^\circ\) to radians. Express your answer as a fraction of \(\pi.\)
  \item Convert the angle \(11\pi/6\) to degrees.
  \item Two complementary angles measure \(x^2\) and \(x^2 - 8\) degrees. Find \(x,\) assuming it is a positive number.
\end{enumerate}
