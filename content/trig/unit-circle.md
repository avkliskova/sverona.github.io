## Problem Set 2
From the [Review Exercises](https://openstax.org/books/algebra-and-trigonometry/pages/7-review-exercises) for chapter 7, do 18-48 even, except for 34.

## The Unit Circle

It's time to connect the circle with the angles on it with what we learned in the previous section.

{{% div class="example" %}}
Consider a circle of radius 1. Using two radii, form an angle in standard position (see diagram in class.) What happens as the angle increases from zero to \\(90^\circ\\) or \\(\pi/2\\) radians?

Consider the coordinates at special angles; show that they form special right triangles with hypotenuse 1.
{{% /div %}}

Now we will connect this to sine and cosine. Previously, these functions were only defined for non-right angles in a right triangle; that is, *acute* angles only. We shall now define them for any angle at all.

{{% div class="definition" %}}
The *sine* and *cosine* of an angle \\(\theta\\) are defined as the y- and x- coordinates of the point where an angle \\(\theta\\) in standard position intersects the unit circle.

(See diagram in class.)
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="example" %}}
Consider one of the triangles with hypotenuse 1 that we've been studying. What does the Pythagorean theorem and the new definition of sine and cosine tell us?
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="example" %}}
Using special right triangles, verify the values for sine and cosine of \\(0, \pi/6, \pi/4, \pi/3,\\) and \\(\pi/2\\) that were given previously.
{{% /div %}}

We can fill out the rest of the unit circle, too, because the values for sine and cosine repeat in all quadrants. however, they may be negative and they may be in reverse order.

However, there's no need to memorize them all, because we can just use the first-quadrant angles over and over again, and use symmetry.

Here's the rule to remember: Angles on the same 'X' have the same sines and cosines, up to a sign change. (See diagram in class.)

We can figure out what the sign changes are by using the quadrant of the angle.

{{% div class="example" %}}
Using the 'X' method, find the sine and cosine of \\(210^\circ\\), \\(300^\circ\\), and \\(7\pi/4\\).

Complete the unit circle with values for sine and cosine of all indicated angles.
