## Abstract
There exists a natural correspondence between the bases for a given finite-dimensional representation of a complex semisimple Lie algebra and a certain collection of finite edge-colored ranked posets, laid out by Donnelly, et al.Â in, for instance, [Donnelly 2003].{{% sidenote %}} Robert G. Donnelly. Extremal properties of bases for representations of semisimple Lie algebras. *Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics*, 17, 2003. {{% /sidenote %}}In this correspondence, the Serre relations on the Chevalley generators of the given Lie algebra are realized as conditions on coefficients assigned to poset edges. These conditions are the so-called *diamond, crossing, and structure relations* (hereinafter *DCS relations*.) New representation constructions of Lie algebras may thus be obtained by utilizing edge-colored ranked posets. Of particular combinatorial interest are those representations whose corresponding posets are distributive lattices.

We study two families of such lattices, which we dub the *generalized Fibonaccian lattices* \\(L\_A^{Fib}(n + 1, k)\\) and *generalized Catalanian lattices* \\(L\_C^{Cat}(n, k)\\). These respectively generalize known families of lattices which are DCS-correspondent to some special families of representations of the classical Lie algebras \\(A\_{n + 1}\\) and \\(C\_n\\). We state and prove explicit formulae for the vertex cardinalities of these lattices; show existence and uniqueness of DCS-satisfactory edge coefficients for certain values of \\(n\\) and \\(k\\); and report on the efficacy of various computational and algorithmic approaches to this problem. A Python library for computationally modeling and "solving" these lattices appears as an appendix.

Chapter 2 provides the necessary background for the sequel, assuming an undergraduate-level knowledge of group theory, graph theory, and linear algebra. In particular, we introduce the basics of [lattice theory](lattice-theory), of representation theory, and of [the theory of Lie algebras](lie-theory).

In [Chapter 3](supporting-graphs), we present Donnelly's notion of a *supporting graph*, which makes explicit the aforementioned correspondence between posets and representations, following [Donnelly 2003]. We furnish several examples of such poset-representation correspondences. In particular, we define the *generalized Fibonaccian lattices* \\(L_A^{Fib}(n+1, k) = \mathscr F(n + 1, k)\\) and illustrate some examples.  We also reproduce an explicit formula for \\(|\mathscr F(n + 1, k)|\\) from [DDMN 2022]{{% sidenote %}}Robert G. Donnelly, Molly W. Dunkum, Sasha V. Malone, and Alexandra Nance. Symmetric Fibonaccian distributive lattices and representations of the special linear Lie algebras. In preparation, 2022.{{% /sidenote %}} which specializes to the result that \\(|\mathscr F(3, k)|\\) is the Fibonacci number \\(F_{2k + 2}.\\)

In [Chapter 4](catalanian-lattices), we introduce the *generalized Catalanian lattices* \\(L_C^{Cat}(n, k) = \mathscr C(n, k)\\) and illustrate some examples. We also prove a nice, explicit, and apparently new formula for \\(\vert L_C^{Cat}(n, k)\vert = \vert \mathscr C(n, k)\vert\\). Finally, we demonstrate uniqueness of DCS-satisfactory edge coefficients for lattices in this family.

[Chapter 5](motzkin-paths) introduces two well-known combinatorial constructs and
proposes a bijection between them. The *topside peakless Motzkin paths* (TPMPs) are lattice paths obeying some simple constraints; we show that the number of TPMPs of length \\(n\\) is given by the \\(n\\)th peakless Motzkin number. *Littlewood-Richardson tableaux* are generalizations of Young tableaux which appear prominently in enumerative combinatorics. We conjecture that Littlewood-Richardson tableaux of a certain shape \\(P_n/Q_n\\) are equinumerous with length-\\(n\\) TPMPs and provide some empirical evidence to support this claim.

[Chapter 6](computational-methods) gives an overview of the algorithms and Python code used to produce the illustrations and some of the foregoing results.
