A *identity* is an equation that is always true. A *trigonometric* identity involves trig functions.
For instance:
1. *Pythagorean identities:* \\(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1.\\)
  Also: \\(\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta; 1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta.\\)
2. *Even/odd identities:* \\(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin \theta.\\)
    Other odd functions: \\(\tan(-\theta) = \tan \theta; \cot(-\theta) = -\cot \theta; \csc(-\theta) = -\csc \theta.\\)
    Even functions: \\(\cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta ; \sec(-\theta) = \sec \theta.\\)
3. \\(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}.\\) (Reciprocal identities.)
  Also: \\(\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta; \csc \theta = 1/\sin \theta.\\)
4. \\(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}.\\) (Quotient identities.)
  Also: \\(\cot \theta = \cos \theta / \sin \theta.\\)

## Verifying trigonometric identities

To *verify* an identity means to show that it is always true.

For instance: \\(\sec \theta (\sin \theta + \cos \theta) = 1 + \tan \theta.\\)
How could you show this is always true?

Some tricks:
- Start at the more complicated side and try to simplify it.
- Try converting to sines and cosines.
- Try cross-multiplying.
- When you see one side of an identity, try using it.
- If something looks familiar, try to make it into an identity you already know.
- Work with both sides independently until you get the same thing on both sides. **Never cross the equal sign.**

Some more identities to try:
1. \\(\csc \theta \cos \theta \tan \theta = 1.\\)
2. \\((1 + \sin x)(1 + \sin(-x)) = \cos^2 x.\\)
