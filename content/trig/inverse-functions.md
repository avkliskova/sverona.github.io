We've been studying *trigonometric functions* that take an angle (usually measured in radians) and that output a number (a coordinate, a slope, ...) Now we're going to look at those functions' inverses.

## Inverses review

Remember, an *inverse* function undoes the function it's an inverse of. So if I have \\(f(x) = y,\\) the inverse function has \\(g(y) = x.\\) The original function turns \\(x\\) into \\(y\\); its inverse turns \\(y\\) back into \\(x.\\)

To take a simple example, we know that \\(\sin(\pi/2) = 1.\\) We call the inverse function of sine \\(\arcsin.\\) So \\(\arcsin(1) = \pi/2.\\)

In general, to find \\(\arcsin(y),\\) we need to find the number \\(x\\) such that \\(\sin(x) = y.\\)

Let's do some examples with these.

{{% div class="example" %}}
Compute the following.
1. \\(\arcsin(\sqrt{3}/2)\\)
2. \\(\arccos(\sqrt{2}/2)\\)
3. \\(\arctan(\sqrt{3})\\)
{{% /div %}}

## Ranges of inverse functions

There's a problem here, of course. There are many angles that produce the same sine, because sine is periodic! So \\(\arcsin\\) defined as it was is not a function.

We can get around this easily, though.

Pick up here Wednesday.
