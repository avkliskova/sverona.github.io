## Course description
Trigonometry is used to determine lengths and distances based upon angles, or vice versa. Students in Math 117 will be able to apply knowledge of the following topics:

1. the unit circle;
2. trigonometric functions and graphs;
3. trigonometric identities and equations;
4. right triangle trigonometry;
5. laws of sines and cosines;
6. complex numbers and their application to trigonometry, including de Moivre's Theorem;
7. vectors and applications of trigonometry.

Further, students will learn to model and solve problems appropriate for the field of study in majors of the sciences. 

## Learning objectives
This course fulfills the Quantitative Reasoning requirement in the Foundations category of WKU’s Colonnade program. Quantitative Reasoning courses teach students to interpret, illustrate, and communicate mathematical and/or statistical ideas. Students will learn to model and solve problems. As part of that program, Math 117 has the following learning objectives.

Students will demonstrate the ability to:

1. Interpret information presented in mathematical and/or statistical forms.
2. Illustrate and communicate mathematical and/or statistical information symbolically, visually and/or numerically.
3. Determine when computations are needed and execute the appropriate computations.
4. Apply an appropriate model to the problem to be solved.
5. Make inferences, evaluate assumptions, and assess limitations in estimation modeling and/or statistical analysis.

## Prerequisites
4 years of high school mathematics, including Algebra I and II and geometry, and one of the following.

1. Math 116 with a grade of C or better
2. Math ACT  of 27 or better
3. (Math ACT ≥ 22 or Math SAT ≥ 510) and (WKU Math Placement Test or KYOTE College Algebra Test score ≥ 18).

## Important dates
Monday, August 30: Last day to add/drop a course with a 100% refund <br/>
Monday, September 6: Last day to add/drop a course with a 50% refund <br />
Monday, September 13: Last day to add/drop a course with a 25% refund <br />
Monday, November 1: Last day to withdraw from a course <br />
Tuesday, December 14: Final grades posted

## Grading info

There will be ten to twelve **weekly quizzes**, comprising a total of 100 points.

There will be about six **homework assignments**, one due every two weeks, comprising a total of 200 points.

There will be two **midterm exams**, tentatively scheduled for October 1 and November 1, and a final, scheduled for the first full week of December. Each of these tests are worth 100 points. You will take these exams in the [Math Testing Center](https://www.wku.edu/mathtesting/) (COHH 2126). You will need to make an appointment 24 hours in advance of your test date. I will drop your lowest exam score and your \\(n - 10\\) lowest quiz grades, where \\(n\\) represents the total number of quizzes we have.

You may earn extra credit points, up to 5% of your final grade, by showing up to class and being generally attentive and on-task. If I have to ask you to stop what you are doing or take further measures because you are disrupting class, you will forfeit that day's extra credit points. *I will not give extra credit for other tasks; do not bother to contact me about it.*

Thus, the final distribution of your grade is as follows.

| Item | Point value | Percentage of final grade |
|-|-|-|
| Homework | 200 | 40% |
| Top ten quizzes | 100 | 20% |
| Top two exams | 200 | 40% |
| Extra credit | 25 | 5% |


## Math tutoring lab

If you cannot catch me after class or during office hours, the Math Tutoring Lab will assist you with any problems you may have. The lab is open in COHH 2124 from 8:30--4:30 on Monday--Thursday and 8:30--2 on Friday.

## Attendance policy
Attendance will be taken each class day via roll call. If you are attending via Zoom due to COVID-related measures, I will check for your presence two minutes after the class start time. If you experience a technological problem, email me immediately.

## Devices and technology

The use of devices in class is allowed, **except during Friday quizzes**, so long as they are not disrupting other students' learning. If I notice that your device use is interfering with class time, i.e., creating undue noise or visual distraction, I may ask you to cease the distracting activity. Failing that, I may ask you to store your device. Failing that, I may dismiss you from that day's session. *Any such dismissals will be counted as unexcused absences.*

Use of technology during quizzes and exams is strictly prohibited and may be considered an act of academic dishonesty. So don't do it.

I will post lecture notes for each week on this website and link to them via Blackboard; you are welcome to use them as learning aids. These notes will not, however, be a substitute for coming to class.

## Academic dishonesty
Student who commit any act of academic dishonesty may receive from the instructor a failing grade in that portion of the course work in which the act is detected or a failing grade in a course without possibility of withdrawal. 

## ADA accommodation statement
In compliance with University policy, students with disabilities who require academic and/or auxiliary accommodations for this course must contact the Student Accessibility Resource Center located in Downing Student Union, 1074. SARC can be reached by phone number at 270-745-5004 [270-745-3030 TTY] or via email at sarc.connect@wku.edu. Please do not request accommodations directly from the professor or instructor without a faculty notification letter (FNL) from the Student Accessibility Resource Center.

## Sexual misconduct/assault policy
Western Kentucky University (WKU) is committed to supporting faculty, staff and students by upholding WKU’s Title IX Sexual Misconduct/Assault Policy (#0.2070) at https://wku.edu/eoo/documents/titleix/wkutitleixpolicyandgrievanceprocedure.pdf and Discrimination and Harassment Policy (#0.2040) at https://wku.edu/policies/hr_policies/2040_discrimination_harassment_policy.pdf.

Under these policies, discrimination, harassment and/or sexual misconduct based on sex/gender are prohibited.

Please note that while you may report an incident of sex/gender based discrimination, harassment and/or sexual misconduct to a faculty member, WKU faculty are “Responsible Employees” of the University and MUST report what you share to WKU’s Title IX Coordinator or Title IX Investigator. If you would like to speak with someone who may be able to afford you confidentiality, you may contact WKU’s Counseling and Testing Center at 270-745-3159.


## COVID statement

As of August 2021, I am fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (Pfizer) and encourage you in the strongest possible terms to be as well, if you are not already.

All students are strongly encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine.  Out of respect for the health and safety of the WKU community and in adherence with CDC guidelines and practices of all public universities and colleges in Kentucky, the University requires that a cloth face covering (reusable or disposable) that covers both the nose and mouth must be worn at all times when in public areas within all buildings.  Students must properly wear face coverings while in class regardless of the room size or the nature of the classroom activities.  Students who fail to wear a face covering as required will be in violation of the WKU Student Code of Conduct and will be asked to comply or will face disciplinary action, including possible dismissal from the University. Accommodations can be requested in special cases through the Student Accessibility and Resource Center (SARC): 270-745-5004(voice), 270-745-3030 (TTY), or 270-288-0597 (video).

All students must immediately report a positive Covid-19 test result or close contact with a person who has tested positive to the Covid-19 Assistance Line at 270-745-2019.  The assistance line is available to answer questions regarding any Covid-19 related issue.  This guidance is subject to change based on requirements set forth by public health agencies or the office of the governor.  Please refer to the [Healthy on the Hill website](https://wku.edu/healthyonthehill) for the most current information.

**I reserve the right to make changes to these policies at any time.**
