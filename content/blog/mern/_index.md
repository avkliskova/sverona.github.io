Here is most of the code in [James Vickery](https://github.com/jmsv)'s [simple-mern](https://github.com/jmsv/simple-mern) repo, annotated by myself. I thought this would be quicker than reading a big 500-page book.

## Architecture notes
The application is split into [frontend components](../frontend) (under `client/`) and [backend components](../backend) (mostly under `src/`.) The files under the root directory are discussed in [their own post](../node).
