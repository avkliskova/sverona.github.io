*Predecessor Detection, Classification, and Assistance* (PreDCA) is an AI alignment protocol due to [Vanessa Kosoy](https://www.alignmentforum.org/users/vanessa-kosoy). It depends on the *infra-Bayes framework.*

The attendant mathematics is contained in [this sequence on Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/CmrW8fCmSLK7E25sa). Unfortunately there is a rather large gap between The Sequence (written at the level of a graduate textbook) and the various talks/explainers/intuition pumps that already exist.
<!-- <span style="font-size: 32px">HEY S: LINK THE EXPLAINERS AND TALKS YOU USED HERE, THANK YOU</span> -->

<!-- Drawn in by the siren song of complicated mathematics, I cracked my knuckles and decided to write these blog posts to split the difference between The Sequence and everything else on the Internet. You may think of it as a "second course" to be read after consuming the things linked above. -->

<!-- Happy hunting. -->
