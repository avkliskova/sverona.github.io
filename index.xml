A Lie algebra is a vector space \(\mathfrak g\) together with a bracket operation \([ \cdot, \cdot ] : \mathfrak g \times \mathfrak g \to \mathfrak g\) satisfying the following axioms for each \(x, y, z \in \mathfrak g\) and scalars \(a, b\):</description></item><item><title>Supporting graphs</title><link>https://sverona.dev/blog/thesis/supporting-graphs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.dev/blog/thesis/supporting-graphs/</guid><description>We now present the centerpiece of the work. Throughout, write \([n] = \mathbb N \cap [1, n].\)
The DCS relations Let \(L\) be a diamond-colored distributive lattice with edges colored by \([n]\), and let \(x \in L\). For each \(i \in \mathbb N\), let \(\top_i(x) \in L\) be the maximum element of the \(i\)-component in which \(x\) lies.
Define a weight function The quantity \(\rho_i(\top_i(x)) - \rho_i(x))\) is the distance of \(x\) “from the top” of its \(i\)-component, whereas \(\rho_i(x)\) is the distance of \(x\) “from the bottom.</description></item><item><title>Catalanian lattices</title><link>https://sverona.dev/blog/thesis/catalanian-lattices/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.dev/blog/thesis/catalanian-lattices/</guid><description>This section introduces and proves the author's main results.
Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns A Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern or just GT pattern of order \(n\) is an \(n \times n\) lower triangular matrix with integer entries that satisfies \(g_{i + 1, j} \leq g_{ij} \leq g_{i +1, j + 1}\) for any \(1 \leq j \leq i \leq n.\) This definition is equivalent to that given in [@stanley-ec2] §7.10.

Overview of the dc-lattices library In this section we describe the contents of each file listed in Appendix A.
dc_lattice.py contains the abstract initialization and population routines for generic DCDLs. We model a DCDL as a graph using the networkx library.
incremental_lattice.py overrides some methods in dc_lattice.py to handle generic /incremental/ lattices (which, it should be noted, includes every example in this thesis.</description></item><item><title>Angles</title><link>https://sverona.dev/trig/angles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.dev/trig/angles/</guid><description>article div { border: 1px solid black; padding: 1rem; } Here&amp;rsquo;s textbook section 7.1, which these notes cover.
Some basic terms Some of these definitions are here for completeness more than anything else; don&amp;rsquo;t let their number bother you too much.
Basic definitions concerning angles:
A ray is a line emanating from a point. An angle is formed by two rays that share an endpoint. One ray is chosen to be the initial side of the angle, and the other becomes the terminal side.</description></item><item><title>Course Introduction</title><link>https://sverona.dev/trig/introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.dev/trig/introduction/</guid><description>Trigonometry is all about triangles.

For those of you just joining us:
The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers is the largest positive number that divides them both. The Riemann zeta function is the series \[\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac1{n^s} = \frac1{1^s} + \frac1{2^s} + \frac1{3^s} + \cdots.</description></item><item><title>Project Euler 1-100 in 49 hours</title><link>https://sverona.dev/blog/project-euler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.dev/blog/project-euler/</guid><description>Project Euler is how I taught myself Python in high school, and so I find it incredibly nostalgic. It took 13-year-old me a lot of Googling and a few months to get through the first 100 problems.
10-odd years and a graduate degree later, I decided to come back and solve them as fast as I could. I&amp;rsquo;m no competitive programmer, but 24 hours seemed reasonable. Fortunately, I lack the stamina to code for that long, so I did it over a few days instead.</description></item><item><title>Neural networks in time scale calculus</title><link>https://sverona.dev/blog/nabla/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.dev/blog/nabla/</guid><description>Neural networks are a popular technique for machine learning problems such as automated handwriting recognition, automated speech recognition, and time-series forecasting. On these tasks, so-called deep neural networks [Schmidhuber 2015] and convolutional neural networks [Ciresan et al. 2011] have performed at least as well as the best known non-neural-network statistical learning techniques. A typical neural network numerically solves an extremization problem using gradient descent in a high-dimensional Euclidean space using an algorithm known as backpropagation.</description></item><item><title>The dual simplex method, an introduction</title><link>https://sverona.dev/blog/dual-simplex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sverona.dev/blog/dual-simplex/</guid><description>The primal simplex method provides an algorithmic means for solving linear programs (hereinafter LPs.)
