You have 15 minutes. Please show all your work; if I can't follow your logic, I can't give you partial credit.

\textbf{Please put anything with a screen (except calculators) out of sight and leave them that way until you have left the classroom.}

Your answers for all questions should be exact numbers with no decimals.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A 30-60-90 triangle has a shortest side of 3. Find the measures of the other two sides. (Refer to diagram.)
  \item A right triangle has a side of 7 opposite an angle of 45 degrees. Find the measures of the other two sides. (Refer to diagram.) 
  \item A right triangle has sides 5, 12, 13 and non-right angles \(\alpha\) and \(\beta.\) (Refer to diagram.) Find \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta.\)
