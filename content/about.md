Hello! I'm **S.** I am properly addressed as *they, them,* and *theirs.*{{% sidenote %}}Other, stranger pronouns are available upon request.{{% /sidenote %}}

I hold a Master's degree in mathematics from Western Kentucky University.{{% sidenote %}}You can read [my thesis](/thesis) on this very site.{{% /sidenote %}} Presently I make my home in Grand Rapids, by way of Bowling Green and Louisville.

I write software and do mathematics. In my spare time, I make excellent coffee, cook delicious vegan food for my fianc&eacute;, powerlift, run, cycle, and do the masochism tango with the Seattle Mariners.

Some other facts about me:

- I have Erdős number 3.{{% sidenote %}}Erdős [&rarr;](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0118%28199610%2923%3A2%3C119%3A%3AAID-JGT3%3E3.0.CO%3B2-W) Hamburger [&rarr;](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00493-011-2589-4) Dunkum [&rarr;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14991) me{{% /sidenote %}}

- My last name is **Lišková**, which is from Czech and means "the fox." Since [names are somewhat difficult for programmers](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/), I am often forced to use **Liskova**. My given last name was **Malone,** which I changed in 2022 for personal reasons. Therefore I am also recorded as *S. Verona Malone* in some places.
