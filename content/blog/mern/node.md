This post begins our look at [James Vickery](https://github.com/jmsv)'s [simple-mern](https://github.com/jmsv/simple-mern) repository.

## ./README.md, ./LICENSE

These are pretty self-explanatory, so I'll ignore them.

## ./package.json

This is similar to the `package.json` generated automatically by `create-react-app`.  I'll split it up into three sections. The first section contains metadata for `npm`.

```json
{
  "name": "simple-mern",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "description": "the simplest MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) setup",
  "main": "index.js",

  "author": "James Vickery",
  "license": "MIT",
} 
```

The next section specifies custom shell commands to run with `npm`. For instance, `npm start` is an alias for `nodemon index.js`.
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "start:prod": "node index.js",
    "build": "cd client && npm install && npm run build"
  }
}
```

The final section specifies production and development dependencies.
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
    "express": "^4.16.4",
    "mongoose": "^5.13.9",
    "password-generator": "^2.3.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.13",
    "prettier": "^1.19.1"
  }
}
```

Production dependencies are the libraries actually called in by production code; they're necessary to run the app at all. Development dependencies are needed to run things like the test harness. [This StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies) explains this and the other types of dependencies it's possible to specify.

A word on the actual dependencies, since many of them will appear again and again in actual projects:

[`body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) is Express middleware that makes the body of `POST` routes available during routing. It's used primarily for form validation.

If you're reading this you should know what [`express`](http://expressjs.com/) is already. It's a minimal web framework, similar to Python's Flask.

[`mongoose`]() is an object-document mapper; similar to SQLAlchemy or other object-relational mappers, but for MongoDB rather than a relational database.

[`password-generator`]() is what it says on the tin.

[`nodemon`]() is a file watcher and autocompiler. Most static site generators do this by default or make it available as a config option.

[`prettier`]() is a code formatter, similar to Black.

### package-lock.json

This is an autogenerated file containing the entire dependency tree of the project. It's too large to show in its entirety, but part of it looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "simple-mern",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 1,
  "requires": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@sindresorhus/is": {
      "version": "0.14.0",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/@sindresorhus/is/-/is-0.14.0.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-9NET910DNaIPngYnLLPeg+Ogzqsi9uM4mSboU5y6p8S5DzMTVEsJZrawi+BoDNUVBa2DhJqQYUFvMDfgU062LQ==",
      "dev": true
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

In the next post we'll discuss the Express and Mongo backend.
