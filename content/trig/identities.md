A *identity* is an equation that is always true. A *trigonometric* identity involves trig functions.
For instance:
1. *Pythagorean identities:* \\(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1.\\)
  Also: \\(\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta; 1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta.\\)
2. *Even/odd identities:* \\(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin \theta.\\)
    Other odd functions: \\(\tan(-\theta) = \tan \theta; \cot(-\theta) = -\cot \theta; \csc(-\theta) = -\csc \theta.\\)
    Even functions: \\(\cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta ; \sec(-\theta) = \sec \theta.\\)
3. \\(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}.\\) (Reciprocal identities.)
  Also: \\(\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta; \csc \theta = 1/\sin \theta.\\)
4. \\(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}.\\) (Quotient identities.)
  Also: \\(\cot \theta = \cos \theta / \sin \theta.\\)

## Verifying trigonometric identities

To *verify* an identity means to show that it is always true.

For instance: \\(\sec \theta (\sin \theta + \cos \theta) = 1 + \tan \theta.\\)
How could you show this is always true?

Some tricks:
1. Start at the more complicated side and try to simplify it.
2. Try converting to sines and cosines.
3. Try cross-multiplying.
4. When you see one side of an identity, try using it.
5. If something looks familiar, try to make it into an identity you already know.
6. Work with both sides independently until you get the same thing on both sides. **Never cross the equal sign.**

Some more identities to try:
1. \\(\csc \theta \cos \theta \tan \theta = 1.\\)
2. \\((1 + \sin x)(1 + \sin(-x)) = \cos^2 x.\\)  
3. \\(\cos x - \cos^3 x = \cos x \sin^2 x\\)
4. \\((\sin x + \cos x)^2 = 1 + 2 \sin x \cos x\\)

## Sum and difference identities
How can we write \\(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\\) in terms of functions of \\(\alpha\\) and \\(\beta\\) only?

Does \\(\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha + \sin \beta\\)?

Sasha: prove \\(\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta;\\) also \\(\cos(\alpha + \beta.)\\)

How can we get forms for \\(\sin(\alpha - \beta)\\) and \\(\cos(\alpha - \beta)\\) ?

Find an exact form for \\(\sin (5\pi/12).\\)

Find the exact value of \\(\sin 7\pi/12 \cos \pi/4 - \sin \pi/4 \cos 7\pi/12.\\)

## Double-angle identities

How can we write \\(\sin(2\alpha)\\) in terms of only \\(\sin \alpha\\) and \\(\cos \alpha\\) ?

What about \\(\cos 2\alpha\\) ? (Sasha; talk about alternative forms.)

What about \\(\tan 2\alpha\\) ?
