## Some basic terms

Some of these definitions are here for completeness more than anything else; don't let their number bother you too much.

{{% div class="definition" %}}
Basic definitions concerning angles:
1. A *ray* is a line emanating from a point.
2. An *angle* is formed by two rays that share an endpoint. One ray is chosen to be the *initial side* of the angle, and the other becomes the *terminal side.* (Refer to diagram in class.)
3. The *measure* of an angle is the size of the gap between the two rays. We will usually drop the notion of terminal and initial side and focus only on an angle's measure.
4. We say an angle is *positive* if its terminal side is counterclockwise from its initial side, and *negative* otherwise.

The measure of an angle is usually thought of as a portion of a circle, measured in a positive or negative number of *degrees*; more on this later.

There are, of course, 360 degrees in a circle, but angles can measure more than 360 degrees. More on this later.

{{% div class="definition" %}}
An angle is said to be:
1. *acute* if its measure is strictly between 0 and 90 degrees (that is, more than zero, but less than 90);
2. *right* if it measures exactly 90 degrees;
3. *obtuse* if its measure is strictly between 90 and 180 degrees;
4. *straight* if it measures exactly 180 degrees;
5. *reflex* if its measure is more than 180 degrees.

See diagrams in class.

Degrees are indicated by the symbol \\(^\circ.\\)

We can add and subtract the measures of angles like numbers.

Suppose a right angle (see diagram in class) is split into two parts, one with measure \\(3x,\\) the other with measure \\(4x - 1.\\) Find \\(x.\\)

Here's a definition used in surveying, geolocation, and any other matters having to do with small portions of degrees.

{{% div class="definition" %}}
A *minute* of angular measure is 1/60 degree. A *second* of angular measure is 1/60 minute, or 1/3600 degree. Minutes are denoted by the symbol \\(',\\) and seconds by the symbol \\(".\\)

Some more definitions...

{{% div class="definition" %}}
Two angles are said to be
1. *complementary* if they add to \\(90^\circ;\\)
2. *supplementary* if they add to \\(180^\circ.\\)

{{% div class="example" %}}
Two angles are complementary. One has measure \\(26^\circ\\) and the other has measure \\(x^2.\\) Find \\(x.\\)

{{% div class="definition" %}}
An angle in a Cartesian plane is in *standard position* if its initial side coincides with the positive x-axis. (See diagrams in class.)
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="example" %}}
Draw an angle in standard position with a measure of:
1. \\(45^\circ;\\)
2. \\(120^\circ;\\)
3. \\(240^\circ.\\)

What types of angle are these?
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="definition" %}}
1. Two angles in standard position are *coterminal* if their measures differ by a multiple of \\(360^\circ.\\)

2. The *reference angle* for a given angle \\(A\\) is the angle of least positive measure coterminal with \\(A.\\)

Reference angles always measure between 0 and 360 degrees by definition.
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="example" %}}
1. Find an angle that is coterminal with an angle of \\(30^\circ.\\)
2. Find the reference angle for an angle of \\(965^\circ.\\)

## Triangles

{{% div class="definition" %}}
Classifying triangles by sides:

1. *equilateral* --- all sides equal;
2. *isosceles* --- two sides equal;
3. *scalene* --- no sides equal.

See diagrams in class.
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="proposition" %}}
The sum of the angles in any triangle is \\(180^\circ.\\) (See proof by diagram in class.)
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="definition" %}}
Classifying triangles by angles:

1. *acute* --- all acute angles;
2. *right* --- one right angle;
3. *obtuse* --- one obtuse angle.

See diagrams in class. Are these all the possible classifications?
{{% /div %}}

{{% div class="definition" %}}
Congruent and similar triangles:

1. Two triangles are *congruent* if they are the same size and shape; equivalently, if all their sides and all their angles are equivalent.

2. Two triangles are *similar* if they are the same shape; equivalently, if all the angles, but not necessarily all the sides, are equivalent. 

See diagrams in class.

Types of equal angles:

1. *Corresponding* angles;
2. *Alternate interior* angles;

## Degrees and radians

Remember that we can think of angles as fractions of a circle. Let's say we want to measure an angle via the *arc length*, or the actual distance along the circle. The circumference of a (unit) circle is \\(2\pi,\\) so we have the conversion \\[360^\circ = 1 \text{ circle} = 2\pi \text{ units of arc length}.\\] We call these units of arc length *radians.*

{{% div class="definition" %}}
A *radian* is a measure of distance. One radian is the length of the radius of a unit circle.

360 degrees equals \\(2 \pi\\) radians. 180 degrees equals \\(\pi\\) radians. 90 degrees equals \\(\pi/2\\) radians.

\\[\begin{aligned}

2\pi r \cdot \frac{\theta}{2\pi} = \boxed{\theta r } & \quad \text{(in radians)}

\pi r^2 \cdot \frac{\theta}{2\pi} = \boxed{\frac{\theta r^2}{2}}&  \quad \text{(in radians)}
\end{aligned}\\]
