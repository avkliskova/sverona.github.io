It took 13-year-old me a lot of Googling and a few months to get through the first 100 problems. Why 100 specifically? Because I wanted to write this post honestly and those are the ones I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to talk about without them locking my account or something.
10-odd years and a graduate degree later, I decided to come back and solve them as fast as I could.</description></item></channel></rss>
