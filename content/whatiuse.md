title: What I use

## Hardware
**Computer**: My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad X220T. It needs occasional maintenance, but this tends to be very inexpensive. At some point I would like to upgrade to a [refurbished 4:3 model](https://www.xyte.ch/t700-crowdfunding/) --- I keep a T60 in my desk for just such an occasion.

**Phone**: My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S8, which I've had since I was a teen because Phones Are Expensive. This represents a good chunk of my nonfree software usage, and I'm looking forward to getting a PinePhone in the near future.

**Keyboard**: I use an [Anne Pro 2](https://www.annepro.net/products/anne-pro-2) with Kailh Box White switches, flashed with [custom open-source firmware](https://openannepro.github.io/).

## Software
As far as I can, I strive to use open-source software. I am not a license geek; I tend to defer to my friends on such matters.

### Desktop 

**Distribution**: I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org) btw. In the past, I can recall using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com), [Mint](https://linuxmint.com), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org), [Void](https://voidlinux.org), and [NixOS](https://nixos.org). I *really really enjoyed* NixOS, but it created too many yak-shaving problems when I wanted to install anything that wasn't prepackaged.

**AUR helper**: I use [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo). In the past I've used [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) and yaourt, which is unmaintained.

**Window manager**: I use [xmonad](https://xmonad.org) with [xmobar](https://github.com/jaor/xmobar). In the past I've used too many WMs to list. xmonad is the best.

**Terminal**: I use [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org). In the past, I've used [urxvt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rxvt-unicode), [st](https://st.suckless.org), [sakura](https://github.com/dabisu/sakura), and [termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite).

**System font**: I use [Drafting\* Mono](https://indestructibletype.com/Drafting/), which fills my deeply held want for a pretty, open-source monospace serif font that I've had ever since I saw [Triplicate](https://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html). In the past I've used too many fonts to list here.

**Editor**: I use [neovim](https://neovim.io) and [Doom](https://doomemacs.org) with about equal frequency, depending on what I'm doing.

**Browser**: I use [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org), which is far and away my favorite.

**Search engine:** I usually use [SearXNG](https://searxng.org).

**Music player:** I tend to use [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp).

### This very site
This website runs on Hugo using a custom [theme](https://github.com/sverona/hugo-semiotic) of my own design. It uses the [Source Serif](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-serif/) font. It uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org) for math markup.

It is a proud member of the [1mb.club](https://1mb.club). The heaviest page on the site is somewhere around 800KB, almost all of which is font files.

### Nonfree software that I still use

I exclude from this list anything that I absolutely need to function --- banking services, things like that. I am not RMS, who lives in a major city and apparently doesn't need to have normal human relationships, and I'm not interested in taking things to his level.

**Firmware.** There's probably a few blobs in my computer firmware, but right now this doesn't concern me too much.

**Discord.** This is the really big one. I've cleansed myself of most social networking software --- Discord is the only straggler.{{% sidenote %}}I have an obligatory presence on Twitter and LinkedIn but don't use either with any regularity.{{% /sidenote %}} I look forward to a utopian future in which everything is federated and nobody is locked into a proprietary client, but until then, I will conduct most of my business on Discord.{{% sidenote %}}However, I do consider myself a "Discord accelerationist," in that I hope they go under and/or do a bunch of highly objectionable stuff so that I can successfully move most of my friends onto a better solution.{{% /sidenote %}}

**Obsidian.** This has the best mobile client I've been able to find for notekeeping, so it's what I went with when my fianc&eacute;, a relative tech normie, asked me to establish a shared digital notebook. I use neither their paid services (I use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) to share the folder) nor the desktop frontend (I use emacs with [obsidian.el](https://github.com/licht1stein/obsidian.el).)

**Zoom.** It is conceivable that in future I may have enough social leverage to demand that videoconferencing be done on Jitsi or similar, but presently I'm a little too meek to make my friends install yet another app just to speak to me.

**YouTube.** This is one of the last Google holdouts that is not inextricable from my phone. I have to admit that the direction of the platform irritates me more with each passing day, and I would like to separate myself from it entirely.

**Google Maps.** I really like [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app) as a replacement. The one killer feature Maps has that no OSM-based app does is reliable business listings, but that's not a huge deal anyway --- Google listings are wrong more often than anything on a website.
