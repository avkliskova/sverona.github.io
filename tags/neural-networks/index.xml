On these tasks, so-called deep neural networks [Schmidhuber 2015] and convolutional neural networks [Ciresan et al.Â 2011] have performed at least as well as the best known non-neural-network statistical learning techniques. A typical neural network numerically solves an extremization problem using gradient descent in a high-dimensional Euclidean space using an algorithm known as backpropagation.</description></item></channel></rss>
