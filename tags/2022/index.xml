Inspired, I wrote a little Twitter bot that tweets out two such plots each day. I even got a follow from 3Blue1Brown. It was a wonderful source of dopamine for a while.
Because I hacked the thing together in a dayYou can check out the source code, if you&amp;rsquo;re okay with your eyes melting out of your skull.</description></item></channel></rss>
