What follows is a transcription of [these
notes](http://james-keck-memorial-collection.unibs.it/JCKeck-papers/JCKeck-class-notes-from-Feynman's-course-on-MathematicalMethods-at-Cornell-1946.pdf),
which were written by James Keck during a two-part course in
\"Mathematical Methods\",{{% sidenote %}}Presumably for physics.{{% /sidenote %}} taught by Richard Feynman in the fall of
1946 through the spring of 1947.

If Dr. Keck was anything like I was as a note-taker, he probably wrote
down most of this in a hurry. I\'ve added my own notes{{% sidenote %}} In sidenotes, like this one! {{%/sidenote%}} pointing out
skipped leaps in reasoning and hopefully adding some extra mathematical
rigor; fleshed out some of the verbiage so it reads more smoothly; and
corrected the occasional mistake.
