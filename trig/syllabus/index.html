If I notice that your device use is interfering with class time, i.e., creating undue noise or visual distraction, I may ask you to cease the distracting activity. Failing that, I may ask you to store your device. Failing that, I may dismiss you from that day&rsquo;s session. <em>Any such dismissals will be counted as unexcused absences.</em></p><p>Use of technology during quizzes and exams is strictly prohibited and may be considered an act of academic dishonesty.

Out of respect for the health and safety of the WKU community and in adherence with CDC guidelines and practices of all public universities and colleges in Kentucky, the University requires that a cloth face covering (reusable or disposable) that covers both the nose and mouth must be worn at all times when in public areas within all buildings. Students must properly wear face coverings while in class regardless of the room size or the nature of the classroom activities. Students who fail to wear a face covering as required will be in violation of the WKU Student Code of Conduct and will be asked to comply or will face disciplinary action, including possible dismissal from the University. Accommodations can be requested in special cases through the Student Accessibility and Resource Center (SARC): 270-745-5004(voice), 270-745-3030 (TTY), or 270-288-0597 (video).</p><p>All students must immediately report a positive Covid-19 test result or close contact with a person who has tested positive to the Covid-19 Assistance Line at 270-745-2019. The assistance line is available to answer questions regarding any Covid-19 related issue. This guidance is subject to change based on requirements set forth by public health agencies or the office of the governor.
